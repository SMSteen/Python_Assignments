    For this assignment, you're going to create a mini-game that helps a ninja make some money! When you start the game, your ninja should have 0 gold. The ninja can go to different places (farm, cave, house, casino) and earn different amounts of gold. In the case of a casino, your ninja can earn or lose up to 50 golds. Your job is to create a web app that allows this ninja to earn gold and to display past activities of this ninja.
Have /process_money determine how much gold the user should have (hint: youâ€™ll have to set up a custom routing rule)
