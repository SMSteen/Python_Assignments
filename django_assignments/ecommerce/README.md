Learning Django - Week 10 Assignment - Amadon
Build your own e-commerce site called Amadon, into a Django app.  Without creating anything in the database, have the app remember what items you've purchased so far.  
Make sure your app doesn't charge the card again when the customer reloads the 'checkout' page ('checkout' page defined as localhost/amadon/checkout where they see a thank you message).
Additionally, find a better way to prevent a customer from changing the price of your product (using inspect element); for example, have product_id as a hidden variable.

Additional features added outside scope of assignment:
View Cart
Update Cart
Remove Item(s) from Cart
View Order Details (after checkout)

Still to do - add jQuery as a 2nd check on limiting ability to change things through inspect element.
