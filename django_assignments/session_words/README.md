Learning Django - Week 10 Assignment - Session Words
Create a new app called 'session_words'.
Allow the user to add any new word to the session.  The user should be able to choose the color (from list of radio options) to display the word and whether the word should appear in bigger fonts (checkbox).  The user should be able to clear the session as well.
Show the words stored in the session on the right.
